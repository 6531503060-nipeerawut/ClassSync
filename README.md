<p>The “ClassSync” is  a web-based platform designed to streamline attendance tracking and notifications. Students can easily check in for their classes online, mark their attendance, and receive confirmation notifications. Faculty can monitor real-time student attendance via a dashboard, with features highlighting students with low attendance. The system uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js/Express for backend APIs, and the database used for efficient attendance data management is MySQL, which ensures a responsive and mobile-friendly user experience.</p>
